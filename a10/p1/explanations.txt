All C++ libraries are inside the namespace std and if that is not included
then we cannot get input for string, or create string variables or output 
it either. Every String related functionality stops working. We can either
use namespace std, or we can write std:: before every string related 
piece of code. If any C++ libraries were used then they would stop working 
as well

If we remove the prefix, we get the error that name is not declared within 
the scope. The name variable is a variable declared within the Critter Class.
Without the prefix, the function is not referring to that Class and therefore
cannot access the name variable. One possible solution could be to add a second
parameter to the functions, which would be c.hunger or c.name, depending on the
function and then setting its value to the other parameter which is the newname
or newhunger. But it is easier to just reference the function to the class
using the Critter:: prefix.
